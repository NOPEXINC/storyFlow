storyFlow
=========

StoryFlow is a simple set of HTML & JS files that displays the next part of a story based on the user selecting one option from a variety of options. The script will also disable the buttons previously selected so the user cannot 'backtrack' on what they have selected. The selected button will also be highlighted to allow the user to scroll back up to review what they have selected.
